# College Food Nutrition App

## Purpose:

The Food Nutrition Web App will allow college students to quickly and easily find nutrition values of almost any food.
They will be able to find dietary information and recipes base on different filters. This web app will also give suggestions based on the ingredients or nutrition goals students have. Students will be able to compare different nutritional values of 
foods such as protein and carbs. The Web app will provide information and links on support for eating disorders. Eating 
disorders are a common issue that affects people that use food recipie and delivary apps.

## Project Description:

The app will allow users to search by ingredients. The results will be limited to just four results. This number can be adjusted as required. The application utilizes the Edamam API to fetch all food nutrition and recipes. As a team we worked collabratively creating deadlines and kan-ban tasks in GitHub.
